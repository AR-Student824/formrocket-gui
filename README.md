# GUIRocket
A powerful & no backend GUI client for FormRocket, for viewing form responses (beta)

## Note
- This is only for viewing responses for your FormRocket responses, you have to create forms on the official FormRocket website
- This project is now backend-less and only contains 1 file, and can be deployed on Vercel by selecting the `Other` framework, without running into any problems.
